Setup for NCH Interactive Voice Response System https://www.nch.com.au/in/ivr.html

In 2006 I used NCH software to setup an Interactive Voice Response System on an AMD 500MHz computer with a Voice-Win 56K modem. The setup worked well and reliably. Someone would call the work VOIP number, the Computer would answer. It would detect if it was a fax. If it was not a fax signal, it would ask the user to press 1 for Bruce, 2 for Garry, etc. Thus redirecting the call to their mobile phones.

Due to the cost of the software, the startup could not afford it. I would uninstall and reinstall the software to reset the trial timer. When I went to university, moving to Ottawa, this was no-longer possible.
